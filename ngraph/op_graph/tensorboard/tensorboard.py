            1. Tensorboard must be started separately from the terminal using `tensorboard --logdir
               <logdir>`
            2. In tensorboard, "runs" denote individual experiments that can be browsed
               simultaneously. In this way, it's useful to use the same logdir for multiple
               experiments that are conceptually related.
